# A brief history of _Data Science_

[!](highlight)

# Why do we care about data?

- Data is generated from stories.

- If we can find out about the stories, we gain insight.

# The Race of Men's 400m Race

Let's look at the story of the Men's 400m world record times over the years.

            <p>The most recent record was set in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil by
            Wayde van Niekerk by breaking a 17 year-old record, previously set back
            in 1999.</p>

            <p>But such droughts of record breaking are not very common.  There
            have been two times in history that the records were repeately
            broken in quick succession.</p>

            <p>Once in 1939-1941, during the WWII, records were set and broken
            in rapid succession by athlets from Nazi
            Germany and USA.</p>

            <p> Another time in the late 1960s, records were broken by a series
            of black athletes (Tommie Smith, 1967 and Larry James, 1968) in USA,
            coinciding with the <i>civil rights movement</i>.

# This talk is about

- Socio-economical opportunties of data over the last 5000 years (from 3100 B.C.
  2017 A.D.)

- The reactionary invention of technology to gather and analyze data, and

- the role of Computer Science and Data Science in the emerging economy
